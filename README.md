# React + TypeScript + Vite

This is a simple React + Vite + Typescript layout responsive front end exercise of a project based on the three pages only Landing, Login and Dashboard. 

## About the project

You can navigate through the application by clicking in the following components:
- Login button in the navigation bar in the landing page will lead you to the login page
- Sign in button in login page will get you to the dashboard page
- Any other route will lead you to the Not found page.

Also you can find some comments of the development process. For future activities pagination, context api, and authentication would like to be improved, as well as some filtering logic found in the dashboard.
